# Central Dogma Game

## Running Tests

The project includes a small unit test for the `shuffle` utility.
Execute it with Node:

```bash
node game-utils.test.js
```

## Running the Game

Open `index.html` in any modern web browser. If you prefer to serve the files
locally, run a simple HTTP server and navigate to `http://localhost:PORT`. For
example using Python:

```bash
python3 -m http.server
```

Then visit `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.
